                    <h4>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h4>
                    <li>
                        Threat: Encroachment on leopard habitats for agriculture, infrastructure development, 
                        and human settlements leads to reduced prey availability and fragmented populations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consequences: This can limit breeding opportunities, increase human-animal conflict, 
                        and decrease overall leopard numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mechanisms: Protected areas like national parks and reserves play a crucial role in safeguarding leopard habitats. 
                        Additionally, reforestation efforts and wildlife corridors can help connect fragmented populations.

                    <h4>Human-Leopard Conflict</h4>
                    <li>
                        Threat: Instances of leopards preying on livestock or entering villages due to habitat loss can 
                        lead to retaliatory measures like poisoning or trapping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consequences: This can cause unnecessary deaths of leopards and damage their populations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mechanisms: Educational programs for communities living near leopard habitats can promote coexistence and reduce conflict. 
                        Additionally, effective livestock management practices can minimize interactions between leopards and humans.
